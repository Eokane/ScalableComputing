In the tutorial-Workings folder I have uploaded work I hav done on understanding and learning how to implement tornado and flask.
For my cyclomatic complexity task I used tornado

I also found a tutorial online that deals with rest services so I completed that to further aid me in this task
=======
# ScalableComputing
I watched some tutorials on getting started with GitHub
As I am also new to Java Programming I had to take some lesson. I watched some YouTube videos and used Eclipse as my IDE.
I used this site to get started with creating a chat server: http://www.instructables.com/id/Creating-a-Chat-Server-Using-Java/

I also read numerous blog posts on stackoverflow to help me imporve my code and carry out certain aspects of the assignment.


My FINAL DRAFT of the ServerSocket assignment (i.e. assignment1) is saved in the following location in this directory:

ChatServerScalableComputingFinal/src/server/src/main/java/server/  This is the code to be marked and the one I am subnitting for my final grade!

The other folders contain variations of my final code along with tutorials/workings on how I went about learning to implement different features. For example in this directory:ScalableComputing/Assignment 1 Sockets/ChatServer/src/client/ I have learned how to implement hashmaps

In this directory I have learning how to use the mapping function:
ScalableComputing/Tutorial/src/

In the folder Assignment 3 you will find the Cyclomatic Complexity assignment and the Distributed file server
