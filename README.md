# ScalableComputing
I watched some tutorials on getting started with GitHub
As I am also new to Java Programming I had to take some lesson. I watched some YouTube videos and used Eclipse as my IDE.
I used this site to get started with creating a chat server: http://www.instructables.com/id/Creating-a-Chat-Server-Using-Java/

I also read numerous blog posts on stackoverflow to help me imporve my code and carry out certain aspects of the assignment.


My final draft of the ServerSocket assignment (i.e. assignment1) is saved in the following location in this directory:
