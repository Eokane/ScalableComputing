In this folder I have the Server  (CCServerv3.py), the Client (CC_Client.py)and the Graph (png file) calculating the time to complete.

I have also added an excel file containing my results.

In order to calculate the time to completion I ran the server on pycharm and deployed clients using the anaconda command prompt. 
As a result, it was difficult to set each client off working at the same time so there is some discrepancy in my results as more clients were added.
However, I did see a decrease in the total time taken to calculate the complexity as more clients were added to the workforce.
